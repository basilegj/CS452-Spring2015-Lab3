So I sort of cheated when it came to the shape, but I think it's pretty cool. Basically the code takes
the shadedCube example from Angel, and assigns the cube random vertices and colors. 

I didn't quite understand what hint you were trying to give me in the email though. May need to modify this later
I suppose. 

The code modifies the angle of the cube by performing matrix rotations, and uses the Phong method for lighting.
